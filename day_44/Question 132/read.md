Question 132: Discuss the difference between default and named exports in JavaScript modules.

Default exports are used to export a single value from a module. The value can be a function, a class, an object, a primitive value, or any other type of value.

Named exports are used to export multiple values from a module. The values can be functions, classes, objects, primitives, or any other type of value.
